              When I worked at Summari, I had the opportunity to collaborate in
              the creation and maintenance of its mobile, chrome and web apps.
              You can see my work in action downloading the app. It's fun
              getting summaries from the content you usually read. Give it a
              try!

              On 2021, I had some spare time to collaborate on the development
              of a Wallet app for one of OKO's clients. This app allowed the
              clients of a bank pay to different local businesses by searching
              the business in the app, selecting an account and finnaly entering
              the amount to pay.
